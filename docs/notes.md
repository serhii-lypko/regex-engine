Regular expressions describe regular languages in formal language theory. 
They have the same expressive power as regular grammars. But the language of 
regular expressions itself, is context-free language.


# Building blocks:

Alphabet - your set of valid characters
Language - set of valid strings over that alphabet
Finite Automaton (FA) - state machine that accepts/rejects strings
Regular Expression - pattern notation describing languages
Equivalence - FAs and regexes describe the same class of languages

- DFA (Deterministic) vs NFA (Nondeterministic)
- Which is easier to construct from regex?
- Which is easier to execute?
- How do you convert between them?

- What does "nondeterministic" actually mean in practice?
- Why can an NFA have multiple transitions on the same symbol?
- What are epsilon (ε) transitions and why do they matter?
- How does "state explosion" happen in DFA conversion?
